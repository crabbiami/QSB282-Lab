	abstract = {Microplastics have been detected in human stool, lungs, and placentas, which have direct exposure to the external environment through various body cavities, including the oral/anal cavity and uterine/vaginal cavity. Crucial data on microplastic exposure in completely enclosed human organs are still lacking. Herein, we used a laser direct infrared chemical imaging system and scanning electron microscopy to investigate whether microplastics exist in the human heart and its surrounding tissues. Microplastic specimens were collected from 15 cardiac surgery patients, including 6 pericardia, 6 epicardial adipose tissues, 11 pericardial adipose tissues, 3 myocardia, 5 left atrial appendages, and 7 pairs of pre- and postoperative venous blood samples. Microplastics were not universally present in all tissue samples, but nine types were found across five types of tissue with the largest measuring 469 μm in diameter. Nine types of microplastics were also detected in pre- and postoperative blood samples with a maximum diameter of 184 μm, and the type and diameter distribution of microplastics in the blood showed alterations following the surgical procedure. Moreover, the presence of poly(methyl methacrylate) in the left atrial appendage, epicardial adipose tissue, and pericardial adipose tissue cannot be attributed to accidental exposure during surgery, providing direct evidence of microplastics in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Further research is needed to examine the impact of surgery on microplastic introduction and the potential effects of microplastics in internal organs on human health.},

	abstract = {Literature regarding microplastics in the atmosphere has advanced in recent years. However, studies have been undertaken in isolation with minimal collaboration and exploration of the relationships between air, deposition and dust. This review collates concentrations (particle count and mass-based), shape, size and polymetric characteristics for microplastics in ambient air (m3), deposition (m2/day), dust (microplastics/g) and snow (microplastics/L) from 124 peer-reviewed articles to provide a holistic overview and analysis of our current knowledge. In summary, ambient air featured concentrations between {\textless}1 to {\textgreater}1000 microplastics/m3 (outdoor) and {\textless}1 microplastic/m3 to 1583 ± 1181 (mean) microplastics/m3 (indoor), consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene. No difference (p {\textgreater} 0.05) was observed between indoor and outdoor concentrations or the minimum size of microplastics (p {\textgreater} 0.5). Maximum microplastic sizes were larger indoors (p {\textless} 0.05). Deposition concentrations ranged between 0.5 and 1357 microplastics/m2/day (outdoor) and 475 to 19,600 microplastics/m2/day (indoor), including polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate. Concentrations varied between indoor and outdoor deposition (p {\textless} 0.05), being more abundant indoors, potentially closer to sources/sinks. No difference was observed between the minimum or maximum reported microplastic sizes within indoor and outdoor deposition (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Road dust concentrations varied between 2 ± 2 and 477 microplastics/g (mean), consisting of polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene. Mean outdoor dust concentrations ranged from {\textless}1 microplastic/g (remote desert) to between 18 and 225 microplastics/g, comprised of polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polypropylene. Snow concentrations varied between 0.1 and 30,000 microplastics/L, containing polyethylene, polyamide, polypropylene. Concentrations within indoor dust varied between 10 and 67,000 microplastics/g, including polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene. No difference was observed between indoor and outdoor concentrations (microplastics/g) or maximum size (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The minimum size of microplastics were smaller within outdoor dust (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Although comparability is hindered by differing sampling methods, analytical techniques, polymers investigated, spectral libraries and inconsistent terminology, this review provides a synopsis of knowledge to date regarding atmospheric microplastics.},
